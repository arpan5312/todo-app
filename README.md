## 🌱 Vision
This project starts as a **simple terminal to-do app**, but the long-term goal is to make it more than just task management.  

The future direction is about:  
- Making productivity tools feel like they’re **built into your computer**, not just apps you open.  
- Exploring ways to **assist developers directly in their workflow** instead of just reminding them what to do.  
- Experimenting with **AI integration** down the line to turn “to-dos” into actual progress.  

*(More details will come as the project matures.)*
